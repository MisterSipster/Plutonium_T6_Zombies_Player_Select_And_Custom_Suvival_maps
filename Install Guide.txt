Download the files if you have not already and extract them

Run Install_survivals.bat file, this file makes needed folders and copies files to correct folder

Next you can run "Start Plutonium without update.bat" file to open plutonium without removing needed files. 

You are done.

(original plutonium launcher updates all files when opened and this replaces "privategamelobby_project.lua" which is used to show CUSTOM SURVIVAL MAPS option in private game lobby.)

IF YOU USED UPDATER LAUNCHER TO UPDATE FILES OR BY MISTAKE RUN "Install_survivals.bat" AGAIN.

"Start Plutonium without update.bat" opens "%localappdata%\Plutonium\bin\plutonium-launcher-win32.exe" instead of the original launcher which updates all files.

 Survival maps can be chosen by selecting map in MAP and then selecting CUSTOM SURVIVAL MAP.

 After selecting custom survival map you can use START MATCH to play.


**ALTERNATIVE INSTALLION STYLE** (USE THIS IF OTHER ONE DID NOT WORK FOR YOU)

 
copy "privategamelobby_project.lua" to "%localappdata%\Plutonium\storage\t6\ui_mp\t6\menus"" 

copy "scripts" folder to "%localappdata%\Plutonium\storage\t6"

after copying files you still need to use "Start Plutonium without update.bat" or locate "%localappdata%\Plutonium\bin\plutonium-launcher-win32.exe" and use it to start plutonium without updating the client.

**DELETING** 

To uninstall this mod remove all scripts from your scripts folder.
